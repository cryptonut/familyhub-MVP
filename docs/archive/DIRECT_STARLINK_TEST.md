# Direct Starlink WiFi Test

## Simplest Solution

**Just connect your dev phone directly to Starlink WiFi:**

1. **On phone**: Settings → WiFi
2. **Find "Case Starlink 1"** network
3. **Connect** to it (you'll need the password)
4. **Test login**

This bypasses:
- WiFi extender completely
- Hotspot configuration
- USB tethering
- All the complicated stuff

## Why This Works

You said the app works on your other phone when connected to Starlink. So:
- Connect dev phone to Starlink WiFi
- Test login
- If it works → extender is the problem
- If it fails → code/config issue

## If You Don't Have Starlink Password

Check your PC's saved WiFi passwords:
1. **Settings** → **Network & Internet** → **WiFi** → **Manage known networks**
2. Click on "Case Starlink 1"
3. **Properties** → **Network security key** (might be hidden, but you can view it)

Or just ask whoever set up Starlink for the password.

## This is the Fastest Test

No hotspot, no USB, no complications. Just connect to Starlink and test.
