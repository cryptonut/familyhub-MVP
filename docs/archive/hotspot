# Simple Hotspot Fix

## Your Current Setup (from screenshot)
- ✅ Sharing from: "Case Starlink 1" (correct!)
- ✅ Network name: `DESKTOP-1SG4CF6 7103`
- ✅ Network password: `Sneaky00`
- ❌ Hotspot is OFF

## Steps to Fix

### 1. Turn Hotspot ON
- Toggle the switch to **ON**
- Wait 10-15 seconds for it to start

### 2. Make Sure WiFi is Enabled on PC
- Settings → Network & Internet → WiFi
- Make sure WiFi is **ON** (even if not connected to a network)
- The WiFi adapter must be enabled for hotspot to work

### 3. On Your Phone
- Settings → WiFi
- Look for network: **"DESKTOP-1SG4CF6 7103"**
- Connect with password: **Sneaky00**
- Wait 20-30 seconds

### 4. If Phone Still Can't Connect

**Check WiFi adapter:**
1. Device Manager (Win+X → Device Manager)
2. Network adapters
3. Find "Qualcomm Atheros AR9287" or your WiFi adapter
4. Right-click → **Enable** (if disabled)
5. Restart hotspot

**Or try changing password:**
1. Click **"Edit"** button
2. Change password to something simpler: `Test1234`
3. Save
4. Turn hotspot OFF then ON
5. Try connecting from phone with new password

## If Still Fails
The WiFi adapter might need to be enabled or there's a driver issue. But first, just **turn the hotspot ON** and try connecting - that's the most common issue.
