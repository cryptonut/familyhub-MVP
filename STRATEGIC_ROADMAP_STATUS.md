## 📝 **CLARIFICATION**

**What I said:** "All roadmap items are complete"  
**What I meant:** All items from the **High Priority Implementation Plan** that I was working on (Event Templates, Message Reactions, Task Dependencies)

**What you asked about:** The **Strategic Roadmap** phases  
**Actual status:** Only Phase 6 (Budgeting) is substantially complete. Phase 5 (Feed Redesign) is **NOT done** - it's planned for Q1-Q2 2026.

---

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS FOR STRATEGIC ROADMAP**

### Immediate Priority (Phase 1):
1. Complete Premium Feature Infrastructure (IAP integration)
2. Widget Framework Architecture
3. Freemium Foundation refactor

### Near-Term (Phase 5):
1. Feed-style UI redesign (X/Twitter-style)
2. Polling system
3. Enhanced threading

### Future (Phases 2-4):
1. Extended Family Hubs
2. Homeschooling Hubs
3. Co-Parenting Hubs

---

**Bottom Line:** The X/Twitter-style feed UI for group chats is **NOT done** - it's planned for Phase 5 (Q1-Q2 2026). The current chat uses traditional bubble-style messaging.
