- SHA-1: `bb:7a:6a:5f:57:f1:dd:0d:ed:14:2a:5c:6f:26:14:fd:54:c3:c7:1c` ✅

## Now Complete the Process

### Step 1: Click "Done"
Click the **"Done"** button (blue, on the right side of the form)
- This will add the Android app to the table below
- You should see it appear in the "No rows to display" table

### Step 2: Verify It Appears
After clicking "Done", you should see:
- A table row showing your package name and SHA-1
- An "Edit" option if you need to change it

### Step 3: Save the API Key
Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click:
- **"Save"** (blue button)
- This saves all your changes including the Android app restriction

### Step 4: Wait for Propagation
- Wait **2-3 minutes** for changes to propagate

### Step 5: Test in App
1. Open the Android app
2. Menu (three dots) > **"Refresh Session"** (blue option)

## What This Fixes

By adding the Android app restriction with correct SHA-1:
- ✅ Google will accept requests from your Android app
- ✅ Cloud Firestore API is already in the allowed list
- ✅ Application restriction now matches your app
- ✅ Firestore should work on Android!

Click "Done" then "Save" and you're almost there!
