Hi [Brother-in-law's name],

I need help setting up our Flutter app for iOS testing. The Android version is working, but we need to build and test on iOS. Since you have a Mac and dev experience, could you help?

The good news: All the iOS configuration files are already prepared! You just need to:
1. Clone the repo (or pull latest)
2. Install CocoaPods dependencies
3. Open in Xcode and configure signing
4. Build and test

I've created detailed step-by-step instructions in the repo: `IOS_SETUP_FOR_DEVELOPER.md`

Quick summary:
- Repo: https://github.com/cryptonut/familyhub-MVP
- Branch: `develop`
- Bundle ID: `com.example.familyhubMvp`
- Firebase is already configured
- All permissions are set up

Estimated time: 30-60 minutes (first time)

The instructions cover:
- Prerequisites
- Step-by-step setup
- Common issues & solutions
- Testing checklist

Let me know if you have any questions or run into issues!

Thanks!
