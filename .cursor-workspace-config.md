# Workspace Configuration Note

**Issue:** Workspace root is configured as `D:\Users\Simon\Documents\familyhub-MVP` but the actual project is on `C:\Users\Simon\Documents\familyhub-MVP`.

**Workaround:** All file write operations should use absolute `C:\` paths to ensure files are created in the correct location.

**Example:**
- ❌ `write('lib/services/my_service.dart', ...)` → Writes to D: drive
- ✅ `write('C:\Users\Simon\Documents\familyhub-MVP\lib/services/my_service.dart', ...)` → Writes to C: drive

**Future Fix:** Update Cursor workspace root to point to `C:\Users\Simon\Documents\familyhub-MVP`
